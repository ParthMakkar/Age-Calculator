# Age-Calculator
hey everyone.....this is a basic project code in which we use some basics of html , css and javascript.
in this we use some basics input tags and some basics styling tag like margin,getdobfunction in which then can help to take an input from the html input element,it can also retrieve the current date of the year and the month also
 Using some major tags like div,header,input,label,

 And in script tag we can connect a javascript file <script src="script.js"></script>  // here src is the source of the js file

 And whenever we want to add some styling we can use a html.index file to use css styling..

In Age Calculator, we will take the date of birth as the date input and it prints the age from the current date (or specified date). We will create the structure of the Age Calculator using HTML and CSS, and JavaScript will add the functionality to calculate the age in years, months, and days
